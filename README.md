In this project, I worked on time-series data to predict gasoline prices in the United States. 
I was given a dataset with monthly gas prices from April 1994 to February 2021. I created a time series and used point forecast and the Auto Arima method to forecast the price from this given data. 
I received a p-value of 0.2471, and the residual does look like white noise. 
I also showed a couple of methods with which I didn't get an accurate forecast. One such case was using a TBATS model; where the p-value of the residual was 0.0004503.
